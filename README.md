 A fully automatic and fast algorithm that traces fibre-like structures to investigate the nature of such structures.
 Trace Ridges is a method that combines methods of Watershed for ridge detection, Edge detection which breaks any ridges that run from a main ridge towards the sides of the basins, separating them from the minor ones and morphological properties to delineate fibre-like structures.

 Trace Ridges was compared against six other algoritms: Edge detection, CT Fire, Scale Space, Twombli, U-Net and Graph based, with three filtering options: no filtering, Gaussian filtering and DnCnn which is a denoising convolutional neural network. Four images of varying characterisitcs were used for the comparison, Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) images of tumour bearing mouse mammary glands, fluorescently labelled fibronectin images, Breast Cancer Biopsy images of collagen and disease mimicking extracellular matrix.

Trace Ridges outperformed other techniques in total and average distance error metrics and fastest time after Edge detection.

The results of the comparison can be found in this pre-print  https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.04.15.589548v1
